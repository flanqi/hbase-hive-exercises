It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\n\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:\n\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\n\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:\n\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:\nProfile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\n\nTraders and Originators:\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\n\nInformation Technology:\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\n\n\nNext steps \n\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\n\n\nSummary\n\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \n\n\nRegards,\nDave Forster\n713.853.1861\nE-Mail:\tDavid.Forster@enron.com'b"\nIn anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.
