Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.\n\nThe main areas to focus on over the next week are:-\n\n(i) \tRe-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)\t\t\t\tTo be forwarded to Louise\t\n\tThese plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  \n\tThe current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.\t\n(ii)\tBudget (due Jan 3, 2002)\t\t\t\t\t\tTo be forwarded to Faith Killen \n\tFirst year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)\n(iii)\tSeating Plans\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTammy Shepperd to co-ordinate\n\tWe need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.\n\tI have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.\n(iv)\tDue Diligence\n\tWe continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.\n\nI would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.\n\nCommunication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.\n\nIf you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.\n\nHappy New Year\n\nLouise'b'\n<!--\n============================================\nA SPECIAL OFFER\nbrought to you by CBS SportsLine.com\n============================================\nDear ,\n\nWhat better way to celebrate than with fantastic deals from Pizza Hut\n.\nSo order your favorite Pizza Hut\n pizza for a big party or game, and have\na Happy New Year!\n\nTo access and print coupons, click here:\n<A HREF="http://www.sportsline.com/links/6/1/205/excl1231ph3.cgi">http://www.sportsline.com/links/6/1/205/excl1231ph3.cgi</A>\n\nAnd thanks again for choosing Pizza Hut\n.\n<A HREF="http://www.sportsline.com/links/6/1/205/excl1231ph2.cgi">http://www.sportsline.com/links/6/1/205/excl1231ph2.cgi</A>\n\n*********************************************************************\nYou received this e-mail because you registered on CBS SportsLine.com.\nIf you do not want to receive these special e-mail offers you can unsubscribe\nby clicking this link:\n<A\nHREF="http://www.sportsline.com/u/newsletters/newsletter.cgi?email=pallen@enron.com">http://www.sportsline.com/u/newsletters/newsletter.cgi?email=pallen@enron.com</A>.\nYou are subscribed as [{(pallen@enron.com)}] .\n\nAlthough we are sending this e-mail to you, SportsLine.com is not\nresponsible for the advertisers\' content and makes no warranties or\nguarantees about the products or services advertised.
