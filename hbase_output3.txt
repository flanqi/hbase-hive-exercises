b'\nPhillip,\n\nThis section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.  The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.  As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.  We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares).  If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.  Please let me know you preference.\n\nAs you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt.  As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.  He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself)  and the various plan provision amendments.  If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology.  Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.\n\nThanks,\n\nRenee\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: \tAllen, Phillip K.  \nSent:\tThursday, November 01, 2001 8:26 AM\nTo:\tRatcliff, Renee\nSubject:\t\n\nRenee,\n\nThank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units.  It is clear that the payment will be made in shares.  However, I still don\'t understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares.  The plan document under VII.  Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock."  Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account.\n\nThank you,\n\nPhillip Allen'b'\nWow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to=\n you\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----\nFrom: =09Allen, Phillip K. =20\nSent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM\nTo:=09Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John\nSubject:=09FW:=20\n\n\nGreg,\n\nAfter making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my de=\nferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen reg=\narding the Phantom Stock Account. =20\n\nSection 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum dis=\ntribution of all of the participant\'s deferral accounts subject to a 10% pe=\nnalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision =\nof the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined a=\ns of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee re=\nceives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as=\n of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90%=\n of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administ=\nrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yield=\ns a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom St=\nock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. sha=\nres in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that i=\nn several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated th=\nat the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares o=\nf Enron Corp. common stock.\n\nThere are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,=\n  section 6.3 begins with "notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.=\n"  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other se=\nctions of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do no=\nt apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating "a single sum distrib=\nution of all of the Participant\'s deferral accounts" indicates that one pay=\nment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.\n\nThe interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that =\nis the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for t=\nhe Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states "The val=\nue of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closin=\ng price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of pay=\nment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock".=\n  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every=\n share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most =\nbeneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Cor=\np. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond se=\nction 6.3.\n\nThe calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of=\n distribution under each of the three interpretations:\n\n\n\n\nSection 6.3=09=09Plan Administrators=09=09Section 7.1\n\nNumber of shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=096,600=09shares=09=09=096,600 shar=\nes\nRelative share price=09=09$27.23=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$83.13\nPhantom Stock Value=09=09$179,718=09=09=09=09=09=09$548,658\n10% Penalty=09=09=09-17,972=09=09=09 -600=09=09=09=09-54,866\nValue to be distributed=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=09$493,792\nCurrent stock price=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09$10\nDistribution=09=09=09$161,746=09=096,000 shares=09=09=0949,379 shares\n\nI believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the =\nadministrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7=\n.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is =\na hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout. =\n =20\n\nIn addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the=\n same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matt=\ner.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nPhillip Allen   =20\n=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09=09'b"\nPhillip,\n\nThank you for meeting with us today.

A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.\n\nAdditionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.

However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME\'s today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).\n\nSheri\n\nWhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a "Dateline" type theme for one, and a "60 Minute" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)? \n\n\n \n\nCheers Kirk\n---------------------- Forwarded by Kirk McDaniel/HOU/EES on 11/27/2001 09:31 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nKirk McDaniel\n11/27/2001 01:41 AM\nTo:\tMichelle Cash/Enron@EnronXGate\ncc:\tTim O\'Rourke/Enron@EnronXGate, Yevgeny Frolov/Enron@EnronXGate, mery.l.brown@accenture.com, laura.a.de.la.torre@accenture.com, donald.l.barnhart@accenture.com \nSubject:\tRM Simulation Storyline Scripts - Ready for Legal Review\n\nMichelle\n\nThanks for your support of the BRM project.

With regards to the exercising of renewal options, you might be interested to know that the USPS actually renews these 94% of the time; some post offices are in the 75 years and above range on leases. And finally, the construction  costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the USPS requires for contractors. These are well-built facilities, last a long time, and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.\n\nI have added another post office for your consideration. It's in McAllen, is a multi-tenant building, and has a fairly strong cap rate. The flyer is attached.\n\nIn any case, I would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. Do let me know what you've already found, and what you might like to find. I look forward to hearing from you.
